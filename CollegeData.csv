This difference is viewed quite favorably by employers, who say they like our graduates because of their writing and critical thinking skills. The School of Business also is noted for rapidly incorporating innovations and business trends into the curriculum. For example, many employers today are encouraging their workers to earn MBA degrees; therefore, Bellarmine has introduced several programs that take entering freshmen to their MBA degrees in just five (or five and a half) years. Another important aspect to a business education at Bellarmine is the requirement of an internship and/or an international experience. This guarantees that students will gain practical experience while still a student, which makes them much more marketable upon graduation."

It’s not just something we say. It’s something we are. We believe that people make business, and that by treating everyone with respect and empathy, we can learn to make better decisions together. That applies to all the activities we undertake – whether it’s lectures and seminars for students, the world-leading research we carry out, or the way we collaborate with some of the biggest names in the business as we influence professional practice.

The National Center for Industrial Science and Technology Management Development (at Dalian) and the Department of Management Engineering, under the support of China’s Ministry of Education (MOE), National Scientific and Technological Commission, National Economic and Trade Commission, and the U.S. Department of Commerce, were jointly established in 1980, as the first step toward introducing modern U.S. management education into China. In 1984, SEM became the pioneer of Chinese MBA education, launching the first MBA program in mainland China (the program was conducted by a U.S. university, the State University at Buffalo School of Management, until 1990). One of the first management schools in mainland China, the School of Management—the predecessor of SEM—was founded in 1985. In 2007, SEM was selected as the organizer for the China Management Case-Sharing Center (CMCC) for the MBA Education Institutes. Currently CMCC is the world’s largest and highest-quality Chinese Management Case Database.  In the past nearly 40 years, we have been committing ourselves to the faith of “Being Practical and Erudition” and the mission of “To identify, bridge, and advance the best business practices in China and the world thereby accelerating societal prosperity, developing the next generation of inspired business leaders, and contributing knowledge through research, teaching, and outreach”.

 Doctoral",Business,,,,,We educate leaders who make a difference in the world.,"“Leaders”
When we talk about leaders, we mean people who embody a certain type of competence and character—both the competence that comes from the general manager’s perspective the School cultivates and the character to understand the difference between being self-interested and self-centered. It goes far beyond knowing that it’s not right to lie, cheat, or steal. It involves recognizing that you are a true leader only when you have earned the trust of others, and when others, whether in your organizations or your communities, recognize you as such.
“Make a Difference”
Making a difference means people who create real value for society, and who create value before claiming value. I’ve not found anyone who begrudges a leader for claiming value after creating value. Rather, the recent economic crisis showed us too many examples of leaders who claimed value without creating any. It is worth noting here that there are many ways of making a positive difference: as an investor, as a general manager, as an entrepreneur, as an active citizen of your community. Indeed, what distinguishes Harvard Business School is that our graduates provide leadership in all walks of life.
“In the World”
In the world reflects our understanding of a rapidly changing, dynamic environment, and the fact that many of the world’s most challenging issues will require a global perspective. Moreover, it involves embracing the view that the world desperately needs more leaders to address its most urgent and challenging problems, and that virtually none of these problems can be addressed without business leaders playing a vital role.
And, of course, the first component of the mission is educating, which we do in many ways—through our educational programs, through the ideas our faculty produce and disseminate, and through the influence we achieve by being close to leaders of all types, and of organizations all across the world. Here, I would encourage us to recognize that the impact of what we do extends far beyond the people who come to our campus. Although we can touch only a few thousand directly each year, we can indirectly influence many more by remaining the most trusted and admired leader in business education.

Another key is the innovative and customizable curricula we employ to address the unique needs of learners. Our teaching methods go beyond business theory to application.  We promote experiential learning throughout our programs.  Our programs cover far more than just basic functional areas of business (e.g., accounting, economics, finance, marketing, operations, analytics and information technology) and incorporate essential areas of leadership, diversity, equity, and inclusion, globalization, and ethics.  Kelley produces students who are citizens of the world, individuals with strong technological and analytical skills, and leaders who understand the importance of integrity and accountability. As such, graduates are effective at managing uncertainty and ambiguity, responding successfully to challenges, and contributing to their organizations on day one.  Our students advance rapidly in their organizations and throughout their careers because of their commitment to lifelong learning."

The name Insper comes from “to Inspire” and “to belong” (pertencer in Portuguese) which, together with “to transform” were considered to be the three basic pillars of our institution. The school’s history dates back to 1970, when it was established as Instituto Brasileiro de Mercado de Capitais (Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets) in Rio de Janeiro. It began as a research institution, dedicated to studying the operations of financial and capital markets. The first business education programs were started, still in Rio de Janeiro, in 1985. Insper’s mission states that “We develop, at all stages of their professional lives, innovative leaders to make a difference, preparing them to deal with the complexities of the real world, by strongly engaging both faculty and students in the teaching and learning process”. The program portfolio reflects this mission and includes degree programs for pre-professional and professional stages, as well as for academic development. The current portfolio includes Bachelor programs in Business Administration and Economics, three Executive MBAs, one PhD program in Business Economics and two Specialized Masters in Business Administration and Economics. Non-degree programs of Graduate Certificates and Executive Education, both open enrolment and customized, complete the business portfolio. The school also offers undergraduate degrees in Engineering and graduate L.LMs"

This characteristic of the student population gives JSU an opportunity to provide an education with a significant value-added contribution which is not limited to academics, but includes social and cultural contributions as well. Students enjoy relatively small student-to-facutly class sizes with many opportunities to become involved in extracurricular SBI and campus activites."

The story of KBS dates back to a humble non-profit infirmary founded by Dr. Seok-Chang Yoo in 1931 to provide affordable health care to the less fortunate. However, Dr. Yoo found that investing in human capital would make much sense, subsequently turning his attention to raising future agricultural leaders.  In the context of the grim economic conditions of the 1930’s, Dr. Yoo’s ambition of creating a top-class agricultural college was remarkable and ahead of his time. Yet his dedication to nurturing sincere, trustworthy and righteous leaders was hardly unnoticed by his friends; they later stood by him as ardent benefactors to his venture, joining the mission of being the number-one agricultural college. With their help, Dr. Yoo was able to acquire land plots suitable for agricultural practices and seek-out ingenious ways of financially supporting students, showcasing an unusual sense of business acumen and a trailblazing. We believe that reflecting his legacy and character into a modern perspective is important in instructing students, conducting research and interacting with business communities. As such, we want to produce competent students, generate practical business knowledge and expose our students to values of globalization so that they can be responsible leaders impacting international communities.  Please join us in making KBS a place for upbringing students of high caliber and conducting no-nonsense research as well as a trustworthy partner in the globalized community."

Creating a culture of firsts, we have paved the way in Canadian business education by pioneering studies in business ethics, entrepreneurship, social enterprise and co-operative education. We aim to continue this tradition and reinforce our position as a thought leader and champion of sustainability, innovation, inclusion and prosperity all over the world. It is through these efforts that we fulfill our special obligation to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.","On the eastern-most edge of North America lies a province rich with possibilities and which cultivates discoveries.  Newfoundland and Labrador is the first in North America to greet the dawn each day. We were home to the first English settlements on the continent and in 1901, Guglielmo Marconi ushered in the age of wireless communications with the first transatlantic wireless signal at Signal Hill.  It’s a tradition of innovation and leadership that inspires and guides everything we do.  We were the first business school in Canada to launch a co-operative undergraduate business degree. Our commerce program was the first business degree in Canada to receive national accreditation. In 2002, we became the first business school in Atlantic Canada to achieve the world’s most prestigious international accreditation. And in 2018, we created Canada’s first MBA in social enterprise and entrepreneurship.  Like the wild, ever changing natural environment that surrounds us and upon which the province’s culture and history are built, the Faculty of Business Administration continually grows and adapts.  From our early days as a small school with a single program to our current status as a recognized leader in Canadian business and management education, we remain committed to cultivating a vibrant community of students, faculty and staff who seek excellence in all they do. We enable an environment in which leading the way is more than words on paper – it’s built into the very fabric of who we are.  It’s in our nature."

It was officially founded on July 1, 1989. In the early stage of the university, five colleges were set up: College of Humanities, College of Sciences, College of Social Sciences, College of Engineering, and College of Management. College of Law and College of Education were founded in 1998 and 1999, respectively, during his tenure. Altogether, the University currently consists of seven colleges offering 29 undergraduate programs, 44 master programs, 29 Ph.D. programs, and 17 in-service graduate programs. The university has more than 960 faculty/staff members and approximately 12,000 students. The College of Management (hereafter referred to as the COM) is situated in a modern six-storied H-shaped building complex, whose floor space is over nineteen thousand square meters. During the establishment period, the COM consisted of only three graduate institutes, namely the Graduate Institute of International Economics, the Graduate Institute of Finance, and the Graduate Institute of Business Administration. Two additional graduate institutes, the Graduate Institute of Accounting and the Graduate Institute of Information Management were established further in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Nowadays there are five departments within the COM, including the Department of Economics, the Department of Finance, the Department of Business Administration, the Department of Accounting, and the Department of Information Management, have been founded as for undergraduate programs.

In both campus and online settings, the purpose of this education is to meet the needs of business, industry, society and government for skilled and knowledgeable employees.    EMPHASIS: The business program in the COBAIS is student centered and designed to empower our graduates with the tools they need to launch their careers as principled business leaders. Preparation for the global environment of business is an emphasis embedded in the curriculum and something to which all students are exposed. Entrepreneurial leadership focuses on the partnership between the COBAIS and the University’s Small Business Development Center. As an institution focused on teaching future business leaders, we are committed to supporting high-quality faculty whose research both contributes to their discipline and the practice of their discipline as we feel this has the greatest impact on business acumen of our students. Research in pedagogy, while important, is secondary to bringing applied business research into the classroom. In our campus and online undergraduate program and online masters programs, we strive to have inclusive learning environments. While we have a world-wide outreach through online learning, we are predominately a regional university, with rural central western Pennsylvania as our primary service area. We have unique stakeholders and students to serve. Therefore, we must foster a spirit of intellectual inquiry, equity, and tolerance in the classroom and workplace, and hold integrity as the cornerstone of our actions.","Why Clarion? Our approach in the College of Business Administration and Information Sciences focuses on developing the skills our students need for employment and/or graduate school. Over 90 percent of our faculty have work experience in the areas in which they teach. Our faculty share knowledge and experience with our students, giving them the tools employers require. Our AACSB International accreditation is a mark of excellence held by less than 10 percent of business programs worldwide. We offer a variety of associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees with several majors, minors, and concentrations. Some programs are offered 100 percent online, allowing maximum flexibility for students. Our business programs focus on global leadership and entrepreneurship. Global leadership involves corporate-level decision processes, while entrepreneurship is more creative in nature and students have the opportunity to turn an idea into a business.

It grew out of the Department of Factory Management, the Department of Trade Economics, and the Program of Finance and Accounting. These three departments were established in 1950 and were the first business administration programs in China. With a history of more than 60 years, the School of Business has produced significant numbers of professional managers for businesses and government agencies, trained faculty for higher education institutions, and developed a large number of new programs and research fields. As a pioneer in management education in China, the School of Business has authored textbooks widely used in Chinese universities and advised government and businesses in decision-making and enterprise reform. The School of Business has seven departments with 136 full-time faculty members with specializations in all major disciplines, including both cutting-edge researchers and effective instructors. The school's Business Administration program is designated by the Ministry of Education as a Level I National Key Subject and is therefore eligible for government support. Only four other programs in China have the same recognition. The Business Administration program was ranked A+ (the highest rank) in China during the last national evaluations in 2017. Enterprise Management, Industrial Economics and Accounting have also been ranked as Level II National Key Subjects. The School of Business has two PhD programs in seven disciplines, five professional master's programs, and two undergraduate programs in six disciplines, covering all areas of business administration education."

Rutgers University–Camden prepares business professionals to become catalysts of change. Creativity, flexibility, and collaboration are among the critical skills that we incorporate into our curriculum – skills that are needed now more than ever.

Their stories highlight the collective positive impact each of us can have, and one to which, as a business professional, I hope you will commit.  The Rutgers School of Business–Camden, an AACSB International-accredited institution, gives you the opportunity to distinguish yourself through interactions with faculty who are world-class educators and researchers and with a creative team of staff members who are dedicated to our students’ success. We are committed to providing you with transformative community engagement and leadership opportunities.

Many describe it as one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives, professionally and personally.

We have nationally top-ranked programs in a wide range of fields including pharmaceuticals, finance, and supply chain management. And our location provides easy access to career opportunities in the New York/New Jersey area. But most students point out their genuine sense of “fitting in” as a key difference in the Rutgers Business School experience.

Our students will recognize, understand, and uphold the social relevance of business decisions, including within the underserved sections of the society.  We uphold this mission because we recognize our twin roles – as a responsible member of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and as a responsive member of the Indian society at large and look at ourselves in a wider context as a ‘Beyond MBA’ institution.  We will accomplish our mission through:  (a) learner-centric pedagogy that will emphasize attitudes, including spirituality and skills as much as knowledge; (b) exposing students to value-based growth in underserved parts of our communities; (c) synthesis of competition-based western efficiency and collaboration-centric eastern ethos in our intellectual contributions and curriculum; and (d) intellectual contributions aimed at influencing practice.  In our students, we recognize a predisposition and willingness to be a doer first. We also emphasize sensitivity to the social footprint of business actions and the role of spirituality in a balanced approach to decision making.  In our faculty members, we recognize a commitment to delivering outstanding learner-centric pedagogy by taking advantage of the personal, residential nature of our programmes. We also require them to create and disseminate knowledge aimed at influencing practice.  As a community, we will realize these objectives through integrity, self-accountability, professional discipline, and hard work.  We value operational freedom and uphold an entrepreneurial, agile, flexible, and collaborative culture.","S. P.

As a premier school of management, SPJIMR is noted for pedagogic innovations and pioneering programmes, which have helped the Institute stand out for its unique and distinctive path in management education. SPJIMR has acquired the reputation of meeting societal needs of under-managed sectors by offering unique, purposeful and relevant initiatives. SPJIMR is the first, and perhaps the only B-school in India, to launch a mentorship programme aimed at preparing its participants for top management roles as part of the curriculum.  SPJIMR offers a broad spectrum of programmes and courses for postgraduates, executives, entrepreneurs, returning women, family businesses, non-profits organisations, and government bodies. The dynamic course curriculum, well-qualified faculty, international tie-ups, industry connectivity and highly placed alumni base of SPJIMR result in high placements in top companies of India and abroad.   SPJIMR has been awarded accreditation by the prestigious AACSB International-The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. SPJIMR has been ranked 36th globally in Financial Times Master in Management (FT MiM) ranking 2020. It is the only private run business school in India in FT MiM list. SPJIMR is one of the six Indian institutions ranked in the QS 2021 Global list of the world's top 200 business schools. In the last 3 years, SPJIMR has won AACSB's innovations that inspire award twice. In each case, it was the only Indian institute to win the award. SPJIMR’s PGMPW (Post Graduate Management Program for Women) has won the AMBA Innovations award in 2019.  The Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM), Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGPM) and Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) programmes are approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), India.

Our range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes has been carefully designed to meet the needs of school leavers, fresh graduates and more seasoned professionals. Most importantly, we strive to ensure that our graduates are equipped with the requisite set of skills needed for a successful business career. While the academic curriculum is a key part of a holistic education, we also offer numerous extracurricular opportunities such as overseas exchanges, internships and service learning / language enhancement programmes, to nurture students as whole-person business leaders and responsible citizens. Academic rigour is necessary to succeed, but personal integrity is vital. Our students benefit from the type of education that will assist them not only in business, but in every aspect of their lives.  Our faculty are renowned for their innovative approach to research. We work in close collaboration with the private sector to address the practical challenges faced by organisations. We also engage with the public sector, helping to assess the business implications of new policies. Faculty members are often retained as consultants, advisors or board members of major organisations, both private and public. This combination of the theoretical with the practical helps explain our reputation as one of Asia’s finest business schools.  In the end, this is a place of ideas, for ideas determine destiny. Through constant innovation built upon a foundation of academic excellence and intellectual integrity, we seek to inspire and challenge our students to unearth their better selves and to build a better world.

Research: Scholarly research is key to the life of a business school.

At Tobin, we believe that operating ethically and with a passion for high principle is a powerful business and career strategy. It's not surprising that our alumni lead great organizations worldwide. The multi-million USD Student Managed Investment Fund allows students, under the supervision of an advisory committee of faculty and distinguished alumni, to invest a portion of the university's endowment. Tobin students identify, analyze, and present investment opportunities to the committee. They then become responsible for monitoring the performance of their portfolio, and making real buy, hold, or sell decisions. Earnings fund scholarships for economically disadvantaged students. The Executive-in-Residence Program enables Tobin students to serve as consultants to actual for- or not-for-profit companies. Reporting to and guided by clients' senior managers, students seek solutions to complex, real-world, business challenges. Consulting engagements with real challenges, real responsibilities, and real consequences, require real work, and really bright, really capable students. Tobin students are afforded the opportunity to study at St. John's Graduate Center in Rome, Italy. The Graduate Center's five- to seven-week semesters allow students to seamlessly dovetail their studies in Rome and New York. Since all required MBA courses are offered at the Graduate Center, students also have the option of completing their entire degree in Rome. Earning all or part of an MBA from an AACSB-International accredited business school in the middle of the European Union is an invaluable professional achievement and personal experience."

Our students obtain a state-of-the-art business education and also gain a global perspective and learn to think critically and write well—hallmarks of a liberal arts education.  Our program highlights international experiences, with 100% of students studying away from campus for at least two weeks. We are also the only business school in the world that guarantees students an internship in a foreign country.  Employers see the value of a Susquehanna education. With a 98% placement rate within six months of graduation, our graduates clearly earn the education that employers value.

Issues that have an effect on both business and society. At TIAS we are convinced that business can help to solve these challenges. The purpose of our school is to develop leaders who serve society by transforming business. Because at TIAS we believe business exists to serve society. The idea behind this vision, is that business corporations can no longer act as isolated economic entities detached from the broader issues of society. We believe companies have the opportunity and the obligation, to use their scale and expertise, to reshape society.  We teach the leaders of today and tomorrow, new management paradigms. Management paradigms that go beyond short term profit maximization. To be profitable is important; however, we should no longer focus on profit maximization only. We integrate the concept of Creating Shared Value into all our research and education. Long-term business strategies, new sustainable business models, stakeholder engagement and innovation play an important role in all our curricula.  The commitment to develop leaders who serve society by transforming business, is part of our DNA as The Business School of Tilburg University. We encourage people to Never Stop Asking.

Sanchez, Jr. School of Business is to provide accessible superior academic programs and research from a multicultural and international perspective that enables our students to become successful professionals.","Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) was originally known as Texas A&I University at Laredo. Texas A&I University was established in 1970 as an upper level educational center to meet the demand for teacher education and business programs. In 1977, as programs expanded, the University became an upper division school of the South Texas University System and came to be known as Laredo State University. In 1989, the South Texas University System was abolished and Laredo State University became a part of the Texas A&M University System. The student population of TAMIU reflects that of the surrounding community and border region, being 94% Hispanic, 2.5% International, and 2.3% White (fall 2017 data). TAMIU serves the needs of a high number of economically disadvantaged, first-generation students who would otherwise have no access to higher educational services in the region. A recent ranking of TAMIU by CNN Money states the institution is one of the ten least expensive universities in the country with a very high percentage (about 84%) of its student population on financial aid and 65% receiving Pell Grants. The ARSSB MBA program was recently rated the third lowest priced among AACSB accredited schools in the State. U.S. News and World Report ranks TAMIU as #1 in the U.S. among Colleges with Hispanic enrollment"

Being able to choose your coursework every quarter allows students to be nimble as well as maximize their time. We only have one required course that all students must complete called Leadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD). Past that, students select one course each in the three foundations of accounting, microeconomics, and statistics; however, they choose the level of the course, so they can build on their previous education and take more advanced classes from day one if desired. Students also take six courses in management (decisions, people, strategy), business functions (finance, marketing, operations), and business environment—again, in a level of their choice. The remaining 11 courses are electives, encouraging students to explore their unique areas of interest. Students can take up to six classes across the University of Chicago."

The idea that business success and contributing to society are complementary guides UNC Kenan-Flagler. Since our earliest days, we have sought faculty who excel at research and teaching. We were one of the first business schools to teach students teamwork before the business world embraced the power of collaboration. Our core values — excellence, leadership, integrity, community and teamwork — provide the foundation for our collaborative, innovative, diverse, and inclusive culture. The UNC Kenan-Flagler community understands that through our work we build better business and a better world. Mission: We aim to become the best business school of the 21st century. We will achieve that by staying rooted to the three pillars of our history: Educational Excellence, Thought Leadership, and Serving with Purpose. Educational Excellence: Education remains the heart of our mission. We develop new ways to deliver a rich curriculum to undergraduates, graduate students and executives that prepares them to lead change. Thought Leadership: Our faculty develop research-based insights to solve the challenges businesses and society face. We weave that future-focused and research-based expertise into every class and executive education program. The Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise and our centers provide further research opportunities, as well as forums where faculty, executives and policymakers explore new ideas. Serving with Purpose: UNC Kenan-Flagler’s culture is the secret ingredient for producing exceptional graduates who lead with integrity amid increasing complexity and rapid change. Service is the common thread winding through our School. We help businesses become more sustainable, strengthen the state’s economy and deploy students, faculty and staff to volunteer at local service organizations.","Because the school is so siloed with its program staff, there is not a general ""catch-all"" contact.  The best route is to go to the website and select the program from there.  Thank you!"

Vision  The Coggin College of Business aspires to be the institution of first choice for business education, serving North Florida with top quality faculty excelling in teaching and scholarship, and sharing with students their passion for life-long discovery and community service.  Values  Coggin College staff, students, and faculty work together in a learning community characterized by civility, mutual respect, and open, honest communication.  The distinctiveness of our learning community is exemplified by the values that we consider most important. Specifically, we value: •faculty-student interaction of the highest quality; •global perspective, as an essential aspect of relevant business education; and •commitment to and enthusiasm for continuous learning.   Our faculty and staff embrace these values and encourage our students to do the same. As our students observe professional interactions among faculty, staff and their peers, they are provided with behavioral models to emulate.  Our goal is to live and share these values so that student learning in the Coggin College, which could be limited to receiving information, instead becomes transformational learning. That is, it results in a positive shift in the way students think, view themselves, and view the world around them.   This transformational learning takes place in our classrooms and in experiential learning opportunities such as study abroad; internships; participation in student organizations; involvement in research projects with our faculty; and professional interactions with our staff.   We expect that students who are engaged in the Coggin College learning community will obtain high-quality positions upon graduation and have successful careers as business professionals. As alumni, they become the “Brand” of the Coggin College.","The Coggin College of Business has been named a best business college by The Princeton Review for the fourteenth year in a row. Our faculty are distinguished researchers who are well known nationally and internationally in their areas of expertise, and pride themselves on providing personal experiences and interactions with students. We are an ideal college for high-caliber students and working professionals who want to be challenged by strong undergraduate and master's programs, and who seek to participate in transformational learning opportunities available on-campus and off-campus. Our transformational learning opportunities include internships arranged by our in-house Career Management Center; study abroad programs in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America; and hands-on experience with state-of-the-art business computing technology. Our LITSLAB has cutting-edge optimization software, and our Financial Trading Lab is equipped with the best trading simulation software. For investment experience, our students manage the Osprey Fund and are able to interact with some of best minds in investments and financial services. Capitalizing on our location in the active and growing Jacksonville metropolitan area with nearby beaches, we have partnerships with national accounting firms, financial institutions, insurance companies, transportation companies, logistics companies, and medical services providers, among others. We also have an active and engaged Business Advisory Council committed to growing Coggin and the University of North Florida and expanding opportunities for our students."

Our primary responsibility is to advance disciplinary knowledge. At the same time, our pursuit of teaching excellence and our commitment to the business community compel us to produce scholarship that positively affects pedagogy and practice. Our research intent is to create increasingly rigorous intellectual contributions with impact. Outreach/Service Intent UNIBusiness serves the needs of communities and businesses while providing experiential learning and entrepreneurial opportunities for students. Our service intent is to employ the intellectual strength, practical knowledge and business expertise of faculty members, professional staff and students to advance business and economic development and foster entrepreneurial innovation.","At the University of Northern Iowa College of Business Administration, we are serious about maintaining a cutting edge education while maximizing the return on the money invested in us. All of our efforts are driven by a rigorous strategic planning process. We are constantly assessing the larger business world to determine when educational change is required. All proposals for change are then thoroughly reviewed, often including recommendations from the dean's executive and student advisory boards. Everything we do is the product of careful strategic planning. Success in the job market, exemplary performance on professional assessments such as the CPA Exam, and our own high academic standards suggest that our students are, indeed, leaving us with the education they sought upon admission. We need further evidence, however, both to assure ourselves and others and to alter our academic programs if deficiencies become apparent. Consequently, we have developed a systematic learning assurance process and detailed learning assurance program that measures what University of Northern Iowa College of Business Administration students have learned from us while also identifying topical knowledge that requires strengthening. In response to that information, we then make curricular and classroom adjustments to assure that our students' knowledge base is consistent with market requirements."

We actively promote an academic and working environment that's safe, open and accessible to all, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation or any of the other factors that make each of us unique.

The Ancell School promotes faculty excellence in teaching, intellectual contributions and service to professional and business organizations.","The Ancell School of Business provides a high-quality, personalized learning environment primarily to residents of Western Connecticut and the Tri-State area but embraces students from all states and countries.  We are accessible, affordable, and a school of choice for many who are of the first generation in their families to attend college. Ancell, reflecting its location in Danbury and Fairfield County, has a diverse student body and faculty, affording continual opportunities for cross-cultural experiences. Upon admission to WCSU, undergraduates are free to choose one of six Ancell business majors: Accounting, Cyber-Security, Finance, Management, MIS, and Marketing. The School also offers a general MBA, which can be completed either full-time in a year, or part-time and is normally primarily on-ground. Our MHA program is part-time, blending on-ground, hybrid, and online coursework.  We back our claim to personalized learning in several ways. Ancell classes are small, with an average of 22 and no business class is larger than 26; across WCSU the Faculty/Student ratio is 12:1. Each freshman, transfer, or graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor who meets with them throughout the semester. We foster engagement through the Ancell Commons, which provides free academic support and programs that develop habits for life-long learning. Our location within commuting distance of NYC provides access to unparalleled opportunities for internships and professional positions.  Ancell has robustly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic; our first concern is the safety of everyone in our community: students and their families, faculty, and staff. We understand that education is competing with family health and economic issues; be assured that we at Ancell will do everything possible to ensure a successful experience as we navigate our uncertain present."

Mission The mission of WSU’s College of Business is to offer innovative, high-value business programs that intellectually and experientially engage and challenge our students to equip them for lifelong success in the global community.    Value Statement:  Teaching/Learning Environment  The faculty of the College of Business is committed to fostering an engaging and supportive learning environment that utilizes the Winona and Rochester business community to provide innovative curricular and co-curricular experiential learning.  We encourage:  Supportive professors who… … instill student excitement about learning;  …connect with students as individuals; and  …mentor and encourage students to pursue their goals and dreams.   Experiential learning activities involving students in… … meaningful real-life classroom projects;   …internships or jobs that connect the classroom to business; and …active involvement of students in co-curricular activities and organizations.    Upon graduation our students will demonstrate the ability to… … communicate clearly and effectively; … think critically;  … work collaboratively;  … incorporate multiple perspectives and make responsible decisions; and  … understand and apply current business practices    Value Statement:  Intellectual Contributions   The faculty of the College of Business is committed to fostering an engaging and supportive learning environment that is informed by teaching and learning scholarship and enhanced by applied research that serves other faculty and promotes both human and economic development in Minnesota.    Our scholarship’s primary target audience is business faculty who seek to enhance their teaching through pedagogical advances and a greater understanding of disciplinary knowledge.  The principal product forms consist of peer-reviewed journal articles in learning-oriented journals, textbooks, cases with instructional materials, manuals, chapters in textbooks, instructional software, proceedings and papers presented at academic or professional conferences.  Given our undergraduate programs with no masters/doctoral/executive programs, our College’s portfolio of scholarship emphasizes Teaching and Learning Scholarship – high, Applied or Integrative Scholarship – moderate, and Basic Scholarship – low.    Intellectual Contributions Portfolio Classification: 1. Teaching and learning scholarship – instructional development or the scholarship of teaching (e.g. Journal of Management Education, Journal of Pedagogical Research, Accounting Education: An International Journal, Journal of Education for Business, etc.) and journals or conferences targeting faculty with an enhanced understanding of disciplinary knowledge (e.g. International Journal of Business, Advances in Business Research, Journal of Contemporary Business Issues, Journal of Brand Management, etc.). 2. Applied or integration/application scholarship – applied research or scholarship of application to problems in business and management, primary target audience is practitioners published in trade journals or magazines, technical reports, trade books, and trade meetings (e.g. Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, Harvard Business Review, Journal of Bank Marketing, etc.). 3. Basic or discovery scholarship – basic research that contributes to the stock of knowledge of business and management theory.  Targeting academic researchers seeking to advance knowledge of theory published in top (A or B) disciplinary journals (e.g. Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Marketing Research, Management Science, Human Resource Management, Information Systems Research, Journal of Accounting Research, Operations Research, The Journal of Finance, etc.).    Quality Expectations: We define quality intellectual contributions as those that have undergone a formal peer-review process.  Peer review is defined as a process of independent review prior to publication of a faculty member’s work by an editorial board/committee widely acknowledged as possessing expertise in the field.  The peer review should be independent; provide for critical but constructive feedback (reviewers’ comments/revisions); demonstrate a mastery and expertise of the subject matter; and be undertaken through a transparent process notwithstanding that the individuals involved may be anonymous.  The Austrian Business Dean’s Council journals (ABC ratings) and Cabell’s Whitelist suggest the preferred targeted journals while Cabell’s Blacklist of journals should be avoided.    Impact of intellectual contributions is concerned with the difference made or innovations fostered – e.g. what has been changed, accomplished or improved – in the teaching, practice or theory of business.","The College of Business is focused on preparing today's students to be tomorrow's business leaders. Our programs, which are carefully designed with an appropriate balance of liberal arts and business courses, are responsive to the needs of business. We strive to equip our students with the knowledge, skills and tasks to live, lead, work and grow professionally and personally in the 21st century. We are proud of our fine accomplishments and excellent alumni and we have great expectations as we continue to pursue a path of excellence.  College of Business Vision WSU's College of Business will be recognized by our region's students and employers for innovative engaged learning.

Established in 1949, XLRI is the oldest management school in India. The hallmark of this identity is, not to walk on the beaten path, but to strike new routes; not to benchmark, but to be benchmarked; to be second to none, but to be the first to respond to the needs of the people and the nation; taking up tasks that are bold, but necessary, that which nobody has hitherto taken up. This enterprising and pioneering spirit can be witnessed throughout the history of XLRI.  XLRI has always had and maintains a global outlook. We were the first among management schools in India to internationalise our academic programmes. Renowned personalities, distinguished industrialists, academicians and stewards of Jamshedpur Jesuit Society have been part of the institute as Board of Governors, leaders and administrators, teachers and guides. True to its vision, XLRI strives to offer an education which just does not culminate in a mere degree, but one that inspires future business leaders to respond to the unmet needs of the society.  A key characteristic that sets apart XLRI students from other management schools is MAGIS - a quest for the best, never to settle down for mediocrity and always aspire to excel."
